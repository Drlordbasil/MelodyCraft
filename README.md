# AI Music Composer

## Overview
The AI Music Composer is a Python project that utilizes AI and music libraries to compose original music tracks. It employs machine learning models from either OpenAI or Hugging Face's free pipelines to generate unique melodies, harmonies, and rhythms. 

## Features
- Utilizes a pre-trained AI model to generate musical sequences based on user input or predefined parameters.
- Implements libraries like librosa, pretty_midi, or music21 to convert the AI-generated musical sequences into audio files or sheet music.
- Integrates with online music libraries or APIs to access a vast collection of instrument sounds and add them to the composed tracks.
- Allows users to customize the style, tempo, and mood of the music generated by adjusting input parameters or selecting pre-defined options.
- Provides an interactive user interface for users to preview, edit, and save the generated music compositions.

## Installation
To set up the AI Music Composer on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the program:

```shell
python main.py
```

## Usage
Once the program is running, you can interact with the AI Music Composer through the command-line interface. Follow the prompts to input the desired style, tempo, and mood for the music composition. The program will then generate a unique musical sequence based on your inputs. You can customize the music further, preview it, and save it as an audio file or sheet music.

## Dependencies
The AI Music Composer relies on the following libraries and external data sources:
- OpenAI or Hugging Face's free pipelines: for the AI model that generates the music sequences.
- Librosa, pretty_midi, or music21: for converting the AI-generated musical sequences into audio files or sheet music.
- Online music libraries or APIs: to access instrument sounds and add them to the composed tracks.

Please ensure that these dependencies are installed and accessible before running the program.
